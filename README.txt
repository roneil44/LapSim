This solver is meant to help determine ideal suspension characteristics for a race car under simple idealized conditions
like pure breaking, pure cornering, and pure acceleration. It currently does not take into account many real world affects.

Known missing real world effects:
-tire friction is taken as independent of contact patch so initial camber and toe don't matter
-Missing dynamic compression ratio
